# Locker

Locker is a secure and simple media-hiding application built with Flutter. It allows you to hide and protect your media files such as images, videos, and documents behind a password-protected screen. This app ensures that your private media stays hidden from prying eyes and only accessible to you.

## Features

- **Password Protection**: Protects your hidden content with a customizable password.
- **Hidden Media**: Hide images, videos, and documents securely.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy navigation and use.
- **Secure Access**: Hidden content is only accessible after entering the correct password.
- **Quick Access**: Use the hidden screen feature to quickly access hidden content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed. You can follow the installation guide [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Dart**: Dart should be installed along with the Flutter SDK.
